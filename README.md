Lab 5 website

Requirements:
Your name must appear clearly on the main page.
The web page needs to consume JSON and render it. 
AJAX calls using JQuery may be used to consume an external JSON file (downloading JSON and extract information from key:value pairs) contained in a text file.
Watch this video to learn how
The following JSON object must be consumed, and its information must be placed in a Bootstrap grid.

You must validate your web page for HTML5 compliancy at https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and save the report in a file that you will submit.
You should attach screenshots of your webpages to your report
Write a technical report that contains all the following elements:
What HTML5 tags you used and why you chose them?
Did you use element CSS classes and/or global CSS classes?
How did you consume and parse JSON? 
Which web browsers did you used to view your page and are there rendering differences between browsers?  You may add screenshots to your report.
How long did you spend on this lab?  Length of time includes readings and research and code experimentation.  State time involved in readings and research as well as code experimentation sessions.
